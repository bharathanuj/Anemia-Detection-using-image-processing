# Anemia-Detection-using-image-processing

## Motivation
The main notion of our project is to detect anemia with help of Image processing techniques such as Image augmentation, feature extraction and other machine learning techniques.
(Nutritional anemia is alarming problem. Statistical analysis NFHS5(18-19) data.Significance/complications if it is not diagnoised early. Late diagonisis of anemia can lead to maternal/infant mortality, over/underweight, malnourished children, pre term and less weight babies.) Research gap â€“ non invasive methods to detect anemia.
 They were plethora of malnutrition cases across India, especially in remote areas. People in remote areas were struggling to consult doctors.

## Problem statement

Malnutrition diseases are growing significantly across the globe due to lack of treatment at the early stage.<br>
People in remote areas find it difficult to consult doctor and diagnose the disease at early stage due lack of money and many other reasons.<br>
To alleviate the problems , our proposed model takes the images of eyes and nails to diagnose the malnutrition disease Anemia .<br>
