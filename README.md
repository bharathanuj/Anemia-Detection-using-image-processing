# Anemia-Detection-using-image-processing

## Motivation
The main notion of our project is to detect anemia with help of Image processing techniques such as Image augmentation, feature extraction and other machine learning techniques.
(Nutritional anemia is alarming problem. Statistical analysis NFHS5(18-19) data.Significance/complications if it is not diagnoised early. Late diagonisis of anemia can lead to maternal/infant mortality, over/underweight, malnourished children, pre term and less weight babies.) Research gap â€“ non invasive methods to detect anemia.
 They were plethora of malnutrition cases across India, especially in remote areas. People in remote areas were struggling to consult doctors.
